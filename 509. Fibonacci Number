The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
Given N, calculate F(N).


class Solution:
    def fib(self, N):
        """
        :type N: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        F=[0,1]
        for i in range(2,N+1):
            F.append(F[i-1]+F[i-2])
        return F[N]
